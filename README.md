# DevLeague Modules

## Module Structure

Each module may contain a sub-module, in which case, only contains directories for each sub-module

Each module contains a README.md which is the primary document to start from.

_see module **Module README.md template** below_

Each module may contain sub-directories, given that they are described and referenced from the README

> ## Topics
>
> - a list of topics for this module
> - define a level of understanding for each topic
> - example:

>     - Instantiating Objects [grok]
>     - Class Inheritence [grok]
>     - Interfaces [teach]
>     - Polymorphism [about]

>     - [about] => knows about a topic at a high level enough to know it exists and do further research as needed
>
> ## Acceptance
>
> - criteria used to determine completion of this module
> - answers these questions:
>     - what have the students learned?
>     - what can a student do to demonstrate knowledge or mastery?
>     - how do we know that a student has obtained proper training?
