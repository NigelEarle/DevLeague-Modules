# Object Oriented Programming

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **revealing module pattern** and definitely before **MVC**. Students should already be familiar with **requiring external modules** and **exporting modules**.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 full day to introduce and up to a week's worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce OOP (whiteboard a diagram)
    1. Start with the fundamentals of classes and instances.
        - *Recommend: Whiteboard an example of a blueprint of a house and an actual house.*
    1. Focus on class definition and object instantiation.
    1. Create clear distinction between functions vs. methods, and properties vs. variables.
    1. Demonstrate real-world "OOP" examples.
    1. Introduce inheritance using real-world whiteboard examples.
        - *Recommend: Whiteboard an "Animal Kingdom" example.*
1. Present **ES6 OOP** Slideshow: [http://slides.com/theremix/es6-oop](http://slides.com/theremix/es6-oop)
1. Assign **Kingdom of OOP**: [https://github.com/devleague/Kingdom-of-OOP](https://github.com/devleague/Kingdom-of-OOP)
1. Present **Prototypes in Javascript**: [http://slides.com/jasonsewell/prototypes-in-javascript](http://slides.com/jasonsewell/prototypes-in-javascript) @Jon - this was added in.
1. Assign **JS Constructors**: [https://github.com/DevLeague/js-constructors](https://github.com/DevLeague/js-constructors)
1. Assign **JS Zombies**: [https://github.com/DevLeague/js-zombies](https://github.com/DevLeague/js-zombies)
1. Check in with students and their understanding of **Constructors**, **Inheritence**, and **Super calls** (talk)
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.
