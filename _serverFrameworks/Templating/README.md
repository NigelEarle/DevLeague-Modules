# Templating

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **Express** and definitely before **HTTP**. The students should have already comfortable writing servers with Express. This module will cover the basics of Templating with Pug (Formerly known as `Jade`).

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 hour to introduce and 1 day to implement all the Pug templates methods in their Express Projects.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

1. Assign **Articles, Products, and Express**: [Articles, Products, and Express](https://github.com/devleague/articles-products-and-express)
1. Assign **Express Gallery**: [Express Gallery](https://github.com/devleague/express-gallery)
1. Check in with students and their understanding of **template engines**, and **Pug** (talk)
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.

## Acceptance
